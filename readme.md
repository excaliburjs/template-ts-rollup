# Excalibur TypeScript & Rollup template

**âš  Warning** Rollup does a great job at [building libraries, not necessarily apps](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-and-rollup-the-same-but-different-a41ad427058c) like a game in excalibur. This template is sub-optimal and does not provide tree shaking, the whole of excalibur is included in the bundle. We recommend using the [webpack](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-webpack) or [parcel](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-parcel) templates to build games if possible.

## Getting Started

1. [Generate a repository](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-parcel/generate) from this template
2. Modify the `package.json` with your own details
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start build and watch using Rollup and start a local dev server!
5. Have fun!
